We examine location data gathered from volunteer subjects to quantify how well four different algorithms can identify the subjects' home locations and then their identities using a freely available, programmable Web search engine. Our procedure can identify at least a small fraction of the subjects and a larger fraction of their home addresses. We then apply three different obscuration countermeasures designed to foil the privacy attacks: spatial cloaking, noise, and rounding. We show how much obscuration is necessary to maintain the privacy of all the subjects.},
