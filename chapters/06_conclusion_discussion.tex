\chapter{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{chapter:conclusion}
We have shown that our hypothesis holds but only for aggregated data. This is fine because except in one experimental setting as with trajectories, there is no need for (anonymized) raw data. Also the experimental setting could be replaced by directly implementing the aggregations and testing with a greater user base. In theory, the anonymity and preserved privacy that hold for the tested aggregations hohlds also for the other proposed aggregations and aggregations we have not evaluated here. In order to follow with this research, we provide the setup to easily implement and test those and further aggregations in future research in order to further support our hypothesis.
