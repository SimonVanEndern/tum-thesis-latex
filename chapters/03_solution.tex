Possibilities for the decentralized analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Send data via an application e.g. whatsapp or telegram, that takes care of message encryption (trusted third party)
	\item use encryption methods that allow for aggregation as in \parencite{crowdsourcing}
\end{itemize}

A possiblility to infer information about the whole crowd from just a small subset is investigated by \parencite{subset}

Use data formats according to the platform, that shows the standard for each type of data. (Naming conventions, find this website open data, ... something like that)

Blockchain might be useful in this area as well.
