\chapter{Methodology}\label{chapter:method}
In order to avoid having a central raw dataset and to eliminate the risk of inference attacks on anonymized data, we propose a framework which collects and locally aggregates location data on end user devices (smartphones) through an application designed for this purpose. The raw data will stay on each device and will only be used to serve aggregation requests send from the central server. The aggregation requests have to be defined upfront. Apart from GPS data, we also take other movement data into account - the number of steps and the current activity e.g. walking. These can be used to enrich the pure GPS data. Hence, an example for an aggregation is the determination of the average number of steps per day accross all users participating in the respective aggregation. An examplary aggregation request sent to a smartphone is depicted in Fig. \ref{incoming-aggregation-request}. It specifies the timespan which should be covered by the aggregation, the type of aggregation and the current data combined in the ongoing aggregation.

The response send back to the server after processing the request only needs to contain the data itself, as the type and timespan can be inferred by the server from the request identifier. Figure \ref{outgoing-aggregation-response} shows an examplary response to the server that matches the request in Fig. \ref{incoming-aggregation-request}.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{decentral-aggregation-unencrypted} depicts the overal process of such a decentral aggregation request using an example of 10 participating devices.
In order to protect the user's privacy and completely shield the raw data from the server, it would be necessary to pass the request via P2P from one device to another until the last device finally sends the results to the server. On the one hand, P2P on mobile phones though is still hardly possible, if the devices are not locally close to each other. Otherwise, P2P could be established using WIFI and Bluetooth connections \parencite{p2p-android}. On the other hand, if the server is used to pass an aggreation request from one device to another, it could read the data and compute the respective user's input from the difference. We propose to use encryption in order to hinder the server from reading the data and assume the server to be trusted in the first place. Chapter \ref{chapter:conclusion} discusses this limitation. The modified aggregation process using encryption is depicted in Fig. \ref{decentral-aggregation-encrypted}. On installation of the application on a smartphone, a public-private key-pair is generated and every installed application registers at the server with this public key. The corresponding private key is stored only locally. On start of an aggregation request, not only the first user but also the subsequent user in the chain who should deal with the aggregation request is determined and the public key of this user is passed along with the aggregation request. When one end user device needs to send the processed aggregation request to the next phone, it encrypts the data using the provided public key of the next user leveraging the benefits of synchronous keys using the standard hybrid encryption approach\footnote{In hybrid encryption as used in SSL, the message itself is encrypted with a synchronous key while this key itself is encrypted using the public key.}. This way, the next phone in the aggregation chain will be able to decrypt the request and process the data while the server is unable to read the data until the aggregation request is finally send in plain text for publishing to the server. 
%This process currently assumes a trusted server and trusted devices. Chapter \ref{chapter:conclusion} discusses these limitations.

 The aggregated results are planned to be available through a public route on the server. Nevertheless, we restrict access in our test run to our research team in order to protect the research participants' privacy in case there is a privacy risk we have not thought of. The aggregation requests themselves are initiated by our research team but can be initiated automatically on a regular basis in the future. The next section will detail the planned aggregations.

 \section{Aggregation schemes}\label{aggregation-schemes}
 Two types of aggregation requests are of special interest for our research. First, the aggregation of mean values and second, the aggregation of more advanced statistical values such as median or distribution. The latter includes the possibility to calculate the former and requires the simultaneous availability of each single user's response. %Nevertheless, we want to test all research questions independently.
 The following list is an excerpt of aggregations that would be of interest and can be computed based on GPS location data in combination with the number of steps and the current activity of the respective person:
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item The average number of steps walked across all users participating in the request. (e.g. to calculate how many people reach 10.000 steps per day\footnote{It has to be evaluated, which percentage of steps are registered because the phone will not always be on the person.}.)
	\item The average time spent walking, running, in a vehicle or on a bicycle.
	\item The share of people who combine using a bicycle with using a vehicle such as public transport or a car within one trajectory.
	\item The time spent at work and the time people need to travel to work.
	\item Locations where many participants spend a significant amount of time on a certain day. (A posteriori event recognition)
	\item The percentage of their overall travelling time that people spend on their bike, car, etc.
	\item The average speed on roads.

	%\item Collecting a list of the average number of steps walked by each participant during the timespan.
	%\item Collecting a list of the duration of all registered activities.

	%\item collecting a list of all trajectories registered by the users' phones.
 \end{enumerate}
 For all aggregations, always both, the mean value and if possible, a complete list of single users' mean values in order to compute other statistical figures, are of interest.

 \section{Limiting the spatial area of an aggregation request}
 The aggregation requests outlined in the former subsection only provide useful data if the area of the aggregation can be limited e.g. to the scope of a city. Otherwise the resulting data would not allow for comparison and the scope of each aggregation would either be the whole user base which especially in the case of listing values would result in a huge amount of data passed around. Or, the limited number of participants in each aggregation would not be locally close to each other which would not result in useful data and also make it impossible to do aggregations as the average speed on roads, where you need a certain number of participants providing data about this area. 
 In order to limit the area of aggregation and avoid sending the aggregation request to each user and leaving him with determining whether he is inside the area and participates in the request, the initiator of those requests has to now the location of users, respectively the location where the user is active the most.
 We do not see this as a violation of the user's privacy due to the following reason: The exact location of the user e.g. the home or work location is not of interest at all. Rather the area for which the user can provide data is of interest. We propose to cluster location areas in a hierarchical structure similar to \parencite{casper} and determine the granularity of the location published to the server as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each user sends the most coarse locational area possible to the server - e.g. the continent.
	\item If more than the required anonymity threshold of e.g. 10 active users are already registered with this area at the server, the server not only links this location to the user but also requests the user to send a less coarse location.
	\item The user step by step sends a less coarse location e.g country, district, etc. until the server denies to link the user to the area because not enough active users have registered with the location on this granularity level. The server nevertheless increases a counter of users who requested access to this area. Once the counter exceeds a certain number, the server sends an aggregation request to participants in the more coarse area encompassing the requested less coarse area to determine the number of active users. If this number is above the required threshold, the granularity level for this location is made available and users can now register with this area and aggregation requests targeting this area can be send.
	\item The fullfilment of the threshold has to be checked on a regular basis in order to close areas once the user base sinks below the anonymity threshold.
\end{enumerate}
In a more advanced setting, it should be possible to register with more than one area on the same level to avoid that a user e.g. living close to a city provides only data about the city or the bordering area but not both. Nevertheless, this should be limited to areas bordering each other to avoid user identification similar as in \parencite{privacy-home-work-pairs} and it has to be investigated whether this indeed does not pose a privacy risk to the user or whether also the combination of areas needs to meet a certain anonymity threshold.
